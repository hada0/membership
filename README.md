# Membership API
Synoptic Project - Membership API

This is an API that links an API component with a database component. The database currently exists on a server hosted by DigitalOcean and can be queried with the API HTTP requests.

The existing API requests that can be made are:

  1. GetUserInfo - retrieve data on an existing user.
  2. RegisterUser - stores a new user in the database.
